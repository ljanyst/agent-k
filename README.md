Agent K
=======

An email proxy that tries to give you back some control over how your emails are
handled. It's been created to work around the issues with major email providers
while not forcing you to deal with email delivarability issues.

It's named after Agent K, who spent some time being the postmaster of Truro,
Massachusetts, and did things the [right way][mib] :)
